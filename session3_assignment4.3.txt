Assume that class A extends class B, which extends class C. Also all the three classes implement
the method test(). How can a method in a class A invoke the test() method defined in class C
(without creating a new instance of class C).
6. Expected Output
Select the one correct answer.
a. test();
b. super.test();
c. super.super.test();
d. ::test();
e. C.test();
f. It is not possible to invoke test() method defined in C from a method in A.
